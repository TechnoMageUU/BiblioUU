            Resources
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is a list of resources associated with the library. 
            Just what that might mean is still TBD, but some possibilities are...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Since the library does not participate in inter-library exchange, 
                someone who is remote might want to find out more about an item
                in our collection -- it's very likely some of the BiblioMages would 
                be willing to do that research for that person.
            </li>
            <li>
                On-Request Seminars -- given that we have some depth in some topics -- 
                both in the collection and in the collective knowledge of the mages -- 
                it might be possible to provide ad hoc seminars centered around key
                items in the collection. The most obvious example would be tarot -- 
                I can imagine there would be a reasonable amount of interest in 
                a lecture or seminar or class built around comparing many of the decks
                we have.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We can expand from there, of course.
        </p>
