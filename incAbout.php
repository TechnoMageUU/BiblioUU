            Welcome to the Margot Adler Library.
        </h3>
        <p>
            This library is a research collection of texts, periodicals, 
            and other media related Earth Centered Spirituality and Pagan belief systems.
            <br /><br />
            The library will be available for browsing soon in Frederick, MD.
